# Boyscout riders

Fix-forward backlog. Per the operator's standing rule (**no tiny stories** — see
[[feedback_no_tiny_stories_fix_forward]]), mechanical/bounded work (bug fixes,
one-liners, doc reconciliations, guard tests, file deletions — however many) does NOT
get its own story/journey. It's recorded here and **folded into the next journey** that
runs the gate, so the fix flows through the do-* workflow and produces gate + gallery
proof the operator can see.

`/do-plan` (Mode B) scans this file for riders touching the journey's surface and notes
them in the journey file; `/do-ship` folds them into the task list (sized per its gate)
and **clears the bullet here as it ships**. A standalone journey is filed only for
genuinely new vertical feature scope.

## Pending (filed by /do-retro 2026-06-02, J-0b+J-0c window)

- **modernize-* sunset.** do-* is proven on J-0/J-0b/J-0c (the 2-3 bar is met). Delete the 9
  `modernize-*` skills + ~12 modernize agents and prune the `rolled_up_into:` horizontal
  stories. Mechanical (however many files) → rides forward; ideally after do-* ships one
  *non-migration* journey (early proofs are all fan-out flavored). 47 `implemented/` stories
  stay as history. *(seam: .claude/skills/modernize-*, .claude/agents/*, rolled_up_into stories)*

## Pending (filed by /do-ship 2026-06-04, J-2 window)

- **modernize-\* sunset (carried forward, deferred from J-2).** J-2 was the first non-migration-
  flavored feature journey (the rider's trigger), but the J-2 PR was already large (time-gate +
  412 + unified-motor + Flight migration + the real-export catches), so the ~21-file deletion +
  story-prune was deferred to keep the gate PR reviewable. Ride the next feature journey. *(seam:
  .claude/skills/modernize-*, .claude/agents/*, rolled_up_into stories)* — see the top "Pending" entry.
- **e2e tsc-strictness** — `tsc -p alpenflight/web/e2e/tsconfig.json` reports ~23 pre-existing
  `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`/`maxFailures` errors (`playwright.config.ts`, `flights-list.spec.ts`,
  `aircraft-crud.spec.ts`, `persons-add-modal.spec.ts`, `proof-gallery.spec.ts`, `migration/handshake.spec.ts`).
  Playwright's esbuild transpile tolerates them; harmless until/unless an e2e `tsc` gate is wired.
  *(seam: e2e/tsconfig strict-mode cleanup)*
- **e2e prettier-glob not clean** — `prettier --check 'alpenflight/web/e2e/**/*.{ts,json}'` flags ~42
  pre-existing unformatted specs (repo-wide, predates J-2). A format-normalization pass; don't fold
  into a feature PR. *(seam: e2e prettier normalization)*
- **op-field-mutate test coverage (gap-hunter nit, T-21)** — `FlightCrew.updateOperationalFields` (the
  kept-row in-place reconcile) is only exercised by a re-assert with *identical* values; a changed
  `nrOfLdgs`/time on an unchanged-identity crew row isn't asserted. Code is correct; add the assertion
  on the next flights touch. *(seam: FlightDomainTest / FlightsControllerIT crew-op-field case)*
- **orphaned clubadmin4 realm-user + V29 seed** — T-24 added `clubadmin4` (realm-export user +
  `V29__dev_user_seed_clubadmin4.sql`) as a motor-test principal; T-36 unified motor into /flights and
  the motor test reverted to `fixture.clubA`, leaving clubadmin4 + V29 self-referenced only. Inert
  (realm user + a `t_user` row); a clean removal needs care (removing a landed Flyway migration mid-line
  risks a checksum surprise). Remove on a later journey. *(seam: realm-export.json clubadmin4 + V29)*
- **JIT-username robustness (observation, T-22/T-23)** — `JitUserMaterializerImpl` reconcile-by-username
  (T-23) handles the concurrent-sub-race; the residual is that a genuinely distinct sub reusing a live
  username is rebound rather than rejected — defensible (username = person identity) but worth a
  `legacy-oracle`/security look if multi-IdP lands. *(seam: JitUserMaterializerImpl)*

## Pending (filed by /do-retro 2026-06-03, J-1 window)

_(no pending riders — see Shipped below)_

_Deferred (operator, Q3): fanout-perf (own runner / sharding / no spec co-location) + re-enable
the T-18 J-0c rename test — recorded in the J-1 journey file, not filed as an active rider yet._

_Scan note: no e2e specs carry `@helper`/`covered-by` tags yet → no helper-pruning rider this round._

## Shipped

- **ci.yml path-filter for docs/story-only pushes** — shipped J-2 T-11. Root cause: on
  `integration/**` branches the `pull_request` trigger made `dorny/paths-filter` diff the
  WHOLE PR vs `main`, so `changes.next` was always true (the branch already carries
  alpenflight/ commits) → every doc-only push re-ran build+proof. Fix: a new
  `changes.docs_only` output computed from the INCREMENTAL push diff
  (`github.event.before..after`); the three heavy jobs now gate on
  `next == 'true' && docs_only != 'true'`. Fail-safe toward running (undeterminable range
  → run). `required` aggregator stays green via the existing skipped-to-success case.
